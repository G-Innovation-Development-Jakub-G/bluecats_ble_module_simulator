How to use:

Step 1: Setup ftdi cable and edge1 board

Find edge1 board without bc ble module.
Connect FTDI usb-serial cable from computer to edge1 uart pins 
You should see the ftdi device show up otherwise you may have to install ftdi driver.

Step 2: 

Connect to edge1 LuCi in browser (ethernet or wifi)
Add udp forwarding endpoint pointing to your computer

Step 3:
Run ble module simulator. 
You can use the released binary 'releases/' if available for your platform.
Otherwise, you need to compile from source.

Run
sudo ./ble_module_simulator PATH_TO_SERIAL_DEV NUM_ADS NUM_TAGS AD_RATE_MILLIS UDP_LISTEN_PORT

ex.

sudo ./ble_module_simulator /dev/ttyUSB0 5000 5000 5 9942

output:

Serial Port is /dev/ttyUSB0 
UDP listen port 9942
Sent 225000 bytes: i=5000, 100.00%
